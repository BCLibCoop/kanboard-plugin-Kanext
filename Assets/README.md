# Filetypes

> Possible Kanext filetypes values

## This folder

1. `base` - instructions required by the kanext modifications (e.g. the activity on the dashboard);
2. `fixes` - fix for kanboard in the general sense, applied for all themes;

## ./Skins

Contains the skins which can be applied. Rules:

1. They are automatically loaded if one of the theme plugin they refer to is activated;
2. The Kanext theme is loaded if the configuration specifies so.
