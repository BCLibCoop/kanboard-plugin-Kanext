# Kanext

Improved and expanded theme of [kanboard](https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard) that alters both look and functionality.

## Description

Kanboard provides the basic necessary functionality for handling kanban projects. Moreover, it is a popular piece of software with a lot of community support.

This theme is *not clean* and is *developed in a fast manner*, targeted only to ease the general functionality of Kanboard and improve it's looks.
To provide compatibility with the new Kanboard versions, some of the changes are "hacky" and dirty - sorry about that! :)

I am currently using Kanboard 1.2.6.

### Note

Due to the fact that this theme is not created following the best practices in the main project, this theme will not (yet) be added to Kanboard's plugin directory.

## Installation

1.  First you have to install [kanboard](https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard).
2.  Download or clone this repository into the plugins folder (`plugins`).
3.  Make sure your new folder is named `Kanext`.
4.  That's it. The default-theme is updated.
5.  For more options you can copy the `config.default.php` and rename it to `config.php`.

## Mentions

Nice things to mention about this theme/plugin (newest first):

- it adds a general activity log to the dashboard;
- the default configuration changes the way the tasks are displayed;
- bring heavy modification to the templates of the dashboard;
