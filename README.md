# Kanext

Improved and expanded theme of [kanboard](https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard) that alters both look and functionality.

## Description

Though Kanboard isn't a perfect project as compared to modern technology based boards, provided the basic necessary functionality for handling kanban projects. Moreover, it is a popular piece of software with a lot of community support.

This theme is not clean and is developed in a fast manner, targeted only to ease the general functionality of Kanboard and improve it's looks. To provide compatibility with the new Kanboard versions, some of the changes are "hacky" and dirty - sorry about that! :)

I am currently using Kanboard 1.2.5.

## Installation

1.  First you have to install [kanboard](https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard).
2.  Download or clone this repository into the plugins folder (`plugins`).
3.  Make sure your new folder is named `Kanext`.
4.  That's it. The default-theme is updated.
5.  For more options you can copy the `config.default.php` and rename it to `config.php`.

## Todo

- heavily clean up css;
